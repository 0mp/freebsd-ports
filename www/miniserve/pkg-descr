miniserve is a small, self-contained cross-platform CLI tool that allows you
to just grab the binary and serve some file(s) via HTTP. Sometimes this is just
a more practical and quick way than doing things properly.

Features:

    - Easy to use
    - Just works: Correct MIME types handling out of the box
    - Single binary drop-in with no extra dependencies required
    - Authentication support with username and password
    - Mega fast and highly parallel (thanks to Rust and Actix)

It is an interesting alternative to some popular solutions:

    - darkhttpd: Not easily available on Windows and it's not as easy
      as download and go.
    - Python built-in webserver: Need to have Python installed, it's low
      performance, and also doesn't do correct MIME type handling in some
      cases.
